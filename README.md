### 📝 Project Overview

This repository focuses on applying and implementing machine learning techniques to solve two fundamental problems in the field of computer vision.

#### **Task 1: Image Classification**

This task involves training a model to assign a **label** to an entire input image from a predefined set of categories. The goal is to determine **what** is present in the image (e.g., "cat," "dog," "car").

* *Key files/directories for this task:* (Specify relevant directory/file names, e.g., `classification/`, `train_classifier.py`)

#### **Task 2: Object Detection**

This task is more complex, as it involves training a model not only to classify objects but also to **localize** them within the image. The output typically includes a **bounding box** around each detected object and its corresponding class label. The goal is to determine **where** objects are and **what** they are.


* *Key files/directories for this task:* (Specify relevant directory/file names, e.g., `object_detection/`, `detect_objects.py`)

### 🚀 Getting Started

To set up the project and run the tasks, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repository Name]
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Assuming you use Python and pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You may need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary libraries, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.)*
