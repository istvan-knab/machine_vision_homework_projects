### 📝 Project Overview

This repository focuses on applying and implementing machine learning techniques to solve two fundamental problems in the field of computer vision.

#### **Task 1: Image Classification**

This task involves training a model to assign a **label** to an entire input image from a predefined set of categories. The goal is to determine **what** is present in the image (e.g., "cat," "dog," "car").

* *Implementation File:* `classification.ipynb`

#### **Task 2: Object Detection**

This task is more complex, as it involves training a model not only to classify objects but also to **localize** them within the image. The output typically includes a **bounding box** around each detected object and its corresponding class label. The goal is to determine **where** objects are and **what** they are.


* *Implementation File:* `image_detection.ipynb`

### 🚀 Getting Started (Plug and Play)

This project is designed to be **plug and play**. The environment setup and all necessary shell commands are integrated directly within the Jupyter Notebook files.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repository Name]
    ```
2.  **Open the Notebooks:**
    Launch your Jupyter environment (or use a compatible online platform like Google Colab) and open either `classification.ipynb` or `image_detection.ipynb`.
3.  **Run the Cells:**
    Simply run the cells in the notebook sequentially. The initial cells will automatically execute the necessary **environment setup**, install dependencies, and prepare the software for execution.
